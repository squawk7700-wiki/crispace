    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>At CriSpace, we are fascinated by the idea of making life forms that could one day thrive beyond Earth. We explore advanced—if highly theoretical—genetic editing techniques that might help organisms tolerate cosmic radiation, microgravity, and extreme temperatures.</p>

    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Imagining radiation‑resistant plant genomes to support long‑duration missions.</li>
      <li>Exploring concepts for microbes that could process extraterrestrial resources.</li>
      <li>Speculating on biological adaptations to reduced gravity environments.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Space?</h2>
    <p>Space presents unique challenges that life on Earth has never faced. While our work remains conceptual, it sparks conversation about the limits—and possibilities—of biology in new frontiers.</p>

    <h2>Important Note</h2>
    <p><small>*CriSpace engages in speculative and creative research discussions. Many ideas here are unproven and may never be practical for real‑world application.</small></p>
